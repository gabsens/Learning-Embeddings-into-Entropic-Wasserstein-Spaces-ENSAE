# Spring 2019 *Geometric Methods in ML* project at ENSAE

Work done for the Spring 2019 class of *Geometric Methods in ML* at ENSAE. The instructor was [[Marco Cuturi]](http://marcocuturi.net/).

The report starts with a review of some optimal transport topics (Wasserstein spaces and Sinkhorn divergences). It then moves on to the problem of learning Wasserstein embeddings, with a focus on word embeddings. It finishes with a thorough study of *word2cloud*. We provide our own implementation, and the results we obtained are very promising.
